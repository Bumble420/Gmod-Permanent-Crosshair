# Permanent Crosshair | Bumble's Upload

**A completely permanent crosshair that always shows when in-game.**


# Installation

To install bCrosshair, simply unzip "permanent_crosshair.zip" using any extractor of your choice (I recommend WinRAR) and place the folder labelled "permanent_crosshair" into your "garrysmod/addons" folder and restart your game!

To edit the size, position etc. Go to the permanent_crosshair/scripts/hudlayout.res file.
To disable the default Gmod crosshair, type "crosshair 0" in console.
